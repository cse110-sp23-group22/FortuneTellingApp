The TarotDisplay is an important part of the Tarot Card function as it<br>
fetches the card data and appends the corresponding card image which <br>
displays upon flip. Then, the description is displayed below the card.

* Once the date is selected, the output is mapped from the [TarotCardAnswer.JSON](/source/TarotCardDisplay/TarotCardAnswer.JSON) file.
