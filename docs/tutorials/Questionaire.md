The questionaire is a simple form to retreive user name and birth date to be incorporated into the app.<br> It is intended to provide a more immersive experience to the horoscope reading.
<br> There are two branches of unimplemented features that needs to be worked on in the future.

| Feature     | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Template    | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

* Currently, the switch 
* Textbox under "Speak thy name and unleash the horrors that lie within" captures the name
* 


* Once the date is selected, the output is mapped from the [horoscope.JSON](#) file.
