# Title/Decision Statement
Several Thematic Decisions

## Context and Problem Statement
- To improve user experience, our ap needs improved aesthetics and exapnd on our chosen theme, Cosmic Horror.
- As our team has little graphic design experience and graphics work tends to be taxing, we must balance our aesthetic wishes against workload.

## Considered Options
- Vignette effect
- Lightning effect upon obtaining output, to blackout, to fade in horoscope reading.
- Ryan knows a little blender, could possibly do some 3D renders for backgrounds, icons, etc (with the help of a bunch of borrowed assets)
- Smooth fade out/Fade in transitions?
- Timer on looking at forbidden knowledge, with special background (bloody? Shaking? Tentacles?) for reading pages.
- Gut the horoscope from 12 to 3. Just pick 3 of them. Probably Yog-Sothoth (god who sees past, present, and future), Nyarlathotep (works for the elder gods but hates them and corrupts his followers) and Cthulhu (The collective anxiety of humans). Each one should have 2-4 different responses to randomize.
Gut the birthday as well just have a normal survey to be more thematic
- Visual novel interaction?


## Decision Outcome
- Create new homepage background graphic with clickable sections for horoscope/tarot 
Make transitions between horoscope questionnaire pages 
  - cut entire screen to black, then fade in new questions/reading
- Add bell dong SFX to horoscope transition between questionnaire and reading (Ryan, Tuesday)
- A page turn SFX between questionnaire pages (Ryan, Tuesday)
- Make the reading exit button temporarily only vibrate upon pressing (Ryan, Wednesday)
- During the reading phase, create a timer. As timer ticks down, (Thursday)
- play a heartbeat that progressively beats faster (Ryan)
- Make the screen hue pulse red, and turn progressively more red/darken as timer ticks (intensify vignette) (Eric, Thursday)
- Add a random cough with a blood splatter effect (they appear instantly fade out)
- Screen begins shaking, faster over time(Eric, Thursday)
  - Give player time to read before doing this
- After a certain amount of time, the user can spam exit to actually exit. (Ryan, Thursday)
- POSSIBLY: create a figure offering the horoscope/tarot card readings
