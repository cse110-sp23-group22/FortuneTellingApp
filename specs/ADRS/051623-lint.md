# Use Prettier for Linting

## Context and Problem Statement

In order to maintain the fast pace of a CI/CD development cycle, a linter is
necessary to prevent bad code readability practices from exponentially 
interfering with developer performance.

## Considered Options

Local vs GH Action Linters vs both
- Local: 
  - improves developer experience immediately
- GH Action: 
  - Guarantees that the repo will have some standard of code quality
  - Reduces odd git diffs
- Both:
  - If done properly, removes discrepancies between developer code formatting and auto-fixed code
  - May be difficult to align both linters

There is a github action that works to provide automatic linting processes for code pushed to the repo: Lint Action
- Lint action supports: 
    - Shows linting errors on GitHub commits and PRs
    - Allows auto-fixing issues
    - Supports many linters and formatters

For CSS, there is only 1 style enforcer: 
 - [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) - we will use this as it is the only option available using the Github action
 - However, Prettier also seems to have the capability to lint the CSS style

For Javascript, there are several:
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/integrations) - open source, looks well made + plenty of documentation. ESLint also has error detection that Prettier doesn't so it might be in our best interest to use both. 
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - Looks very popular, used by many different big brands/IDEs, looks very trustworthy + plenty of documentation and a VSCode plugin that will make encforcing style much easier while coding. 
- [XO](https://github.com/xojs/xo) - Seems quite popular but does seem to be a modification of ESLint and implemented through a github repo - definitely seems more open source, despite popularity don't know if we can properly trust it. 
- Example workflow for including the linting in an action: [Example JS lint workflow](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/lint-action#javascript-example-eslint-and-prettier)

For HTML: There are several options that check HTML syntax and formatting, however, Prettier also includes HTML capabilites. Due to the lack of other HTML style check integration into github, we will also use Prettier for HTML style check as it allows us to streamline the process further. 

Local linting: 


## Decision Outcome
- Use Prettier for ALL linting style enforcement.
    - Ask people to install Prettier on their VSCode for local style enforcement
    - Decided to use both ESLint and Prettier for JS style enforcement due to higher ratings on ESLint but Prettier has a wider range of capabilities 
    - Use Prettier to auto format code, ESLint to check if formatting is in good shape - warns about code smells. 
- Will only use Prettier on local and then use both Prettier and ESLint on github action to reduce uneccesary errors at local level through install process and things like that.
