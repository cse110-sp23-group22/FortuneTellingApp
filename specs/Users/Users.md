## Jinshi He:

## Ryan Lee:

- Name: First Last
- Age: 42
- Occupation: Stay at home dad
- Location: Antarctica
- Likes: Hotwheels
- Dislikes: Walking
- Description: Mr. Last mainly likes to watch his Hot Wheels cars go fast. Similarly, he likes to watch the apps he uses go fast. If he has to type more than a few words into a text box, scroll through a huge unsorted dropdown list, or watch a loading wheel for more than 3 seconds, he will probably switch to another app (and then another since that app is too slow, and then another, and another.) He came across our service and likes the idea of having another piece of content to scroll besides his usual social media sites, especially since it’s describing him and telling his fortune specifically. However, like the other sites, our app is still beholden to his miniscule attention span.

## Arjun Kumar:

- Name: Valerie McCrystal
- Age: 27
- Occupation: Sales Rep and Mother
- Location: Salt Lake City, Utah
- Likes: Crystals, Thai food, walks in the park, family dinners, Fall, Girl Scout Cookies
- Dislikes: loud music, teenagers down the street skateboarding in front of her house, spicy food, solicitors
- Description: Valerie is a young mom out of Salt Lake City, Utah. She met her husband sophomore year of high school and they’ve been together ever since. They’ve lived in Utah their whole lives, and recently bought a house, a choice she attributes to her horoscope/crystals. Her son is 3 and she has another on the way. Valerie is a strong believer in the power of crystals and she knows certain crystals have ties to her zodiac signs, so she likes to check her horoscope every morning. She’s found a strong correlation between what her crystals and horoscope tell her and what happens in her life, so she trusts it quite a bit. She expects her horoscope app to give her an accurate reading as soon as she asks for it. She also likes to get frequent readings from Tarot cards, but she doesn’t have time to go to a psychic, so she needs a quick, easily accessible alternative.

## Xin Shu:

- Description: Michael is a young student who is curious about exploring different perspectives. And he is a person who is not good at studying and plays games all day long, so he often uses the tarot card reading feature to decide what to do for the next quarter. He typically uses the app in the evening, when he has some free time to reflect on his day and think about the goals, such as “what should i focus on in my studies this quarter?” After that, he reads the tarot card reading feature so that he has a clear picture in mind of what he shall do next.

## Jiaxin He:

Her two grandchildren are the light of her life, and she loves spending time with them whenever she can. Amily is also a big fan of horoscopes she believes her fate is related to her constellation.
  In her free time, Amily can often be found tending to her garden, which is filled with bright and beautiful flowers, herbs, and vegetables. She enjoys the peacefulness of being outdoors and the sense of accomplishment she feels as she watches her plants grow.
  When she's not gardening, Amily likes to paint and draw. She finds it relaxing and fulfilling to express herself creatively, and she often gives her artwork to friends and family as gifts.

## Jennifer Tanurdjaja:

- Name: Alex Smith
- Age: 16
- Occupation: Student
- Location: California
- Likes: Horror stories/movies, skateboarding
- Dislikes: School, fairy tales, fantasy, church
- Description: Alex grew up with a mother who makes a living as a tarot card reader and is a fanatic of anything related to fortune telling (horoscopes, crystals, incense, etc). After seeing how her mother’s clients willingly believe her mother’s readings and even take action based on these readings, Alex has developed a skepticism for fortune telling and its vagueness. Thus, Alex prides herself in being a realist, but has a strong fascination with horror (realistic horror, of course). The twisted logic and pragmaticism of these horror stories appeal to her because there seems to be a system. However, all this skepticism has left her feeling aimless and purposeless in life. She tells herself that if fortune telling and divination seemed to follow some sort of logic and sense rather than making magical guesses, she would perhaps put more faith into the readings, making her drawn to our app.

## Jiapei Chen

- Bethel Abraham
- Age: 25
- Occupation: Company Staff
- Location: California
- Likes: Games, Horror novels, Traveling
- Dislikes: Work Overtimes, Ominous Signs
- Description: Bethel Abraham is a young man who works at a tech company in California. He works very hard and he never works overtime unless it is necessary. He likes video games, horror novels, and traveling. When there is a vacation, he goes to a new place to travel. Before he departs, he will be aware of tiny details in his life, seeking for possible ominous signs that may foresee his bad fortune in his new journey, because in some horror games and novels, there will always be some warning before something bad happens, and it is always a bad idea to ignore them. Now he is into fortune telling because he thinks it is a more professional way to figure out his future destiny in his future journey. Now he always reads his fortune from some fortune telling apps that claim to have dark power inside them.

## Chris Kim:

- Name: Catherine Taylor
- Age: 26
- Occupation: Bartender
- Location: Seattle, Washington
- Likes: Witty banter, Bar hopping
- Dislikes: Boredom
- Description: Katie loves novelty. Although she doesn’t make a lot, she always makes sure to get the latest technology. She isn’t superstitious in general, but she is recently hooked on horoscopes. She has been using the fortune telling app she found recently and has been testing her fortune with her career and love life. She knows it can’t be real, but it is surprisingly convincing and helps her organize her wants and thoughts. She increasingly uses it more often.

## Eric Chen:

- Name: Cire Videntis
- Age: 38
- Occupation: Engineering Professor
- Likes: Reading novels, Role playing games
- Dislikes: Plot Holes, unexplained discrepancies, wrong facts
- Mental Diagnosis: OCD
- Warning Excessive exposure to imperfections could result in violent reactions
- Description: Cire is a woman of science, and a firm believer of determinism. Don’t take her to be superstitious though, her determinism is rooted within the notions of cause and effect to an extreme scale. She often zones out pondering about every intricacy a topic could have and the effect each action she takes will have. She documents practically everything and has multiple plans within plans. If it wasn’t obvious enough she is a serial perfectionist and not the good kind, the kind that doesn’t get anything done. She was suggested multiple things as treatment to take her mind off of the overwhelming reality, and she has settled into playing along and immersing herself into the worlds of fiction, don’t break her immersion though, especially if the book violates its own rules or screws up Physics 101, she will never touch it again if you do. It was recently suggested to her to pick up divination as a method to essentially be a tiebreaker, when she spends far too long thinking about the pros and cons of each circuit or system design to show in class, she would bring up some divination to maybe push her into picking one over the other and getting the choice over with. Don’t have sloppy divinations though, she’s deleted over 10 divination apps in a week because simple yes or no’s weren’t convincing and overly vague and pretentious ones had no substance that guided her thinking. Checking divination seems to be one of her ways to break her obsession nowadays.
