# Brainstorm #2
Goal: Imagine and describe as much as possible the expected user story. Come up with methods of improving the Horoscope and general app aesthetic by creating tasks that drive team members to implement the user story.

- Vignette effect
- Lightning effect upon obtaining output, to blackout, to fade in horoscope reading.
  - Ryan knows a little blender, could possibly do some 3D renders for backgrounds, icons, etc (with the help of a bunch of borrowed assets)
- Smooth fade out/Fade in transitions?
- Timer on looking at forbidden knowledge, with special background (bloody? Shaking? Tentacles?) for reading pages.
- Gut the horoscope from 12 to 3. Just pick 3 of them. Probably Yog-Sothoth (god who sees past, present, and future), Nyarlathotep (works for the elder gods but hates them and corrupts his followers) and Cthulhu (The collective anxiety of humans). Each one should have 2-4 different responses to randomize.
- Gut the birthday as well just have a normal survey to be more thematic
- Visual Novel dialogue/text box component (directing the player)
- First page can have more horror themes on it
  - Perhaps blood dripping down
Alert
- We have an empty page on the right. Perhaps make dialogue show (including the alert)
- Make things show up letter by letter.
- Eric tried it, he said it’s not reasonable to do buttttt maybe we could try something that will work.

### Eric’s User Story:
The user enters the website and is greeted by diverging paths. 
These paths aren’t explicitly buttons but hover effects clearly show they are clickable. I imagine this to either be some path in the woods or maybe two letters on the table. 
Clicking on either path will give a short description of why the user is there and what aim they have. 
At this point they can still back off and choose the other option. 
Once they confirm a path they will continue. The user should hear footsteps of the character and a door opening and closing into the next area. 
Horoscope path: 
In this path the user would fade into a table where a book lies already open in a dark room. 
The book is initially empty but when a candle is lit and the screen fades brighter the words too start appearing on the book. 
The user doesn’t see any input boxes but an underline for where they place their information. 
Clicking a continue button that looks like a sideways bookmark the candle will suddenly blow out and the words will fade back into the page (clattering noises occur when this happens). Once the candle turns back on new words will appear. Each time the user writes information there will be a small delay. As the user puts in more and more information a faint droning becomes more apparent, maybe a small whisper of ‘escape’.Once all information has been inputted the candle is blown out one final time and all the noises disappear for a brief moment. The users open their eyes to the book once more but there is a faint purple sheen to everything. The noises are gone and the words write themselves. Insert spooky stuff and timer with the player looking at the horoscope.

- Other user stories
  - Shop with only two items (maybe like a peddler) [Just the story]
Try to limit to table, card stack (decoration), and book. If you have to add a figure use a free asset. 

## Tasks
- Create new homepage background graphic with clickable sections for horoscope/tarot (Ryan, Wednesday)
- Make transitions between horoscope questionnaire pages (Eric, Thursday)
- Lazy version: cut entire screen to black, then fade in new questions/reading
  - Cool version 1: Remove individual characters progressively but rapidly, then add back in characters until new prompts are built up.
  - Cool version 2: Fade out using perlin noise map as timers for certain positions.
- Add bell dong SFX to horoscope transition between questionnaire and reading (Ryan, Tuesday)
- A page turn SFX between questionnaire pages (Ryan, Tuesday)
- Make the reading exit button temporarily only vibrate upon pressing (Ryan, Wednesday)
- During the reading phase, create a timer. As timer ticks down, (Thursday)
play a heartbeat that progressively beats faster (Ryan)
- Make the screen hue pulse red, and turn progressively more red/darken as timer ticks (intensify vignette) (Eric, Thursday)
- Add a random cough with a blood splatter effect (they appear instantly fade out)
- Screen begins shaking, faster over time(Eric, Thursday)
- After a certain amount of time, the user can spam exit to actually exit. (Ryan, Thursday)
  - POSSIBLY: create a figure offering the horoscope/tarot card readings
Find a reference for an open book and draw it with the intent replacing the pixel art book.
- Create Tarot cards icons/appearance (Saturday)
### Testing phase
- Write a horoscope response for a single Old One
- Convert a normal horoscope response into one that matches the cosmic/eldritch horror aesthetic
- Write prompts for questionnaire (Both, Saturday)
- Write responses to questionnaire (Both, Saturday)

Horror types:
- Horror vs Terror

Test response:



- How should the questionnaire be designed?
- Are we going to base our questionnaire on real horoscopes (but written more creepily), or on a completely new eldtritch god universe


Questionnaire
- Revamp Questions
- After name and date questions provide “personality” questions that add to a score one of three “old-one-favored-personality” categories: 
  - Cthulhu: Fear/Anxiety
  - Yogg’sothoth: Callous/rational/cynical
  - Nyarlathotep: Deceptive/selfish
- Remove headers
  - Reduce gong volume/change sound
  - Set timer for normal reading, then switch out response for creepy reading
- On attempting to exit to home, cancel and immediately display creepy reading.
change font
