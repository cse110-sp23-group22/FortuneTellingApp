Overall notes:

- People were generally more aware and satisfied with the state of the app and had more clarity about the course of the project
- The mastery of the material still seemed a little low, despite giving teams more room to explore but that is understandable as most of us are still learning the basics of web development
- Members were more confident about their role than after sprint 1 which is an encouraging sign. 
  
- Started with a talk about too much workload, too little time - as we get deeper in the quarter, looking back at the progress we made, while a solid amount, teams were left wishing they had more time to put into the project but unfortunately other committmenets seem to interfere - tough to finish all the tasks to the best of their ability. 
 - Transferred to talking about priority of the tasks moving forward: this included things like UI and what to do about testing as well as improving the thematic elements of the app. 
- Transistioned into talks about testing teams and what is needed to be tested - from E2E and unit testing, teams were looking forward to guidance and specifications of testing for the future. 
- Some UI things on the horoscope module still seem unfinished - mainly the sound on the homepage currently - going to change to wood creaking sound instead of the gong/wind chime thing
- Need to figure out how to properly play sound timing wise
Title slide may stay if we can figure out how to make it not show when user returns to home page
- Happier note: people were happy with the more indepth directions, led to less waiting around and more communication between teams
- Teams were more involved in work, able to sit and work together better than before. Cooperated better with each other better than before.
 

## Action Items
- Prioritize testing and documentation over everything else - crunch time!
- Small changes can still be made, but make sure priorities are in check
- All major tasks need to be finished by Saturday night
- Continue making in depth task descriptions for teams
