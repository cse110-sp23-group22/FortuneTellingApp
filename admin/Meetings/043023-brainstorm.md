# Fortune Telling App Brainstorm Meeting #2
## Setting:
> 4/30/2023 2:00pm, Slack huddle

### Type:
Program Feature Discussion and Brainstorming

## Attendance:
- Arjun 
- Nikan
- Ryan
- Jennifer
- Xin
- Jiaxin
- Eric

## Team Progress:
- Create flowchart of user experience - how we want the app to work
- Define requirements and assignments for next week
## Agenda:
- Start designing what we want app to look like
- User identity
- Look at things we need for project pitch and beyond
## Discussion Notes:
Things we need to prepare for during brainstorming:
- Project Pitch - we will produce a project pitch that will be presented to your team mentor for sign-off.  We will use the ideas from Shape Up to guide this process.  Teams looking to get ahead are advised to read this book now.
- Overarching Decisions - we will eventually capture these as an ADR in markdown 
(/specs/adrs will contain an individual document per major decision.  There will be some initial ones that have to do with general project plan and approach, but more may be added as the project goes on.  The main point of this capture is to explain why choices are made.  As brainstorming may have your team settle on choices quickly capturing them in a document may be better than just mental consensus) 
- User Centered Thinking Documents - we will produce personas and potentially use cases. (/specs/users will contain this but user stories chosen will also be represented as issues to work on)
- System Diagrams - we will eventually capture how your app will be decomposed in C4 diagram, event modeling diagram, or UML form
- Interface Design Documents - we will initially capture "fat marker design" later extended with wireframes and high fidelity prototypes (/specs/interface/rough, /specs/interface/wireframes, /specs/interface/highfidelity  These directories may contain single or multitude of documents)
- Project Roadmap - we will capture a roadmap of how the product will evolve both here in the quarter as well as ideas of how it might grow beyond the time we have with  (/specs/roadmap.md)


**FLOWCHART**: [Initial User Experience Flowchart](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BfApxG_ymwkgU-eDzHjluF1SKmovwAub/view?usp=sharing)

**TASK LIST**: [Github project - task list](https://github.com/orgs/cse110-sp23-group22/projects/1/views/1)


Things we need for the pitch: topics of risks and rabbit holes as well as a visual representation of what you are doing in the form of system diagrams and wireframes.  However, our pitch should also have a statement of purpose as well as a section on user personas.


Plan to pair up people in order to divvy up work but also have someone to bank on for help
- Pair up based on what people would like to work on the app
Development process:
- Start with a basic idea initially and once we get that working start to specialize
    - Generic tarot cards first, break it later if necessary
Avoid using AI for art, unless the art is a sort of one off subject that does not need to be part of a theme or have a theme built off of it OR if we’re desperate.
### Work tasks: 
- Create tarot cards (art)
- Develop frontend????
    - Create forms asking about information about the user (or whether user is willing to give up that info)
    - Display the 
    - You can select either tarot cards or horoscopes on one page
    - Horoscopes
        - Put in some information
        - “Process” information (add a delay)
        - Spit something out
    - Tarot cards
        - Display cards and allow people to pick 1, 3, or 5 cards
        - Ask a few questions again and display info
    - Allow people to loop back to the beginning?
- Testing?
- Wireframing


- User Interaction Flowchart
    - Nikan
- Interface design document
Work preferences
- Ryan: vector graphics-related items??
- Nikan: Designer (assigned)


### Roadmap brainstorm
- Possibly start with horoscopes, which can be simply dots and lines representing constellations
- Tarot cards may be harder
Do we want to focus on just one FT method or do we do two? Is two too much?
- How many user stories do we need? How much tailoring can we do, do we want to do?

Created user experience flowchart to show how we want the app to work and as a reference for folks creating the wireframes and system diagrams


For Tarot card feature:
- Once selected - user is faced with 4 categories of card readings to choose from
- Based on selection, give user option to select 1 or 3 cards (start with 1, expand to 3) and then show their card




## Action Items:
- Create 1 user story per person - by wednesday
- Divvy up work for wireframes and system diagrams - need by thursday
- Everyone read part 1 of [shapeUp](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) - ESPECIALLY CH. 4-6!

## Next Meeting Time:
Tuesday 5/02 @ 3:30pm, Zoom

### End Time: 
3:17 pm
