# Fortune Telling App Brainstorm #1
## Setting:
> 4/29/2023 5:30pm, Zoom

### Type:
Program Feature Discussion and Brainstorming

### Attendance:
- Arjun 
- Nikan
- Ryan
- Jennifer
- Jiapei
- Xin
- Jiaxin
- Chris
- Eric

## Team Progress:
- Decide on main features we want in app
- Start defining the requirements of the app.

## Agenda:
- Go over initial brainstorming ideas - see how to combine them
- Start creating miro board/jamboard

## Discussion Notes:
### Things we need to prepare for during brainstorming:
- Project Pitch - we will produce a project pitch that will be presented to your team mentor for sign-off.  We will use the ideas from Shape Up to guide this process.  Teams looking to get ahead are advised to read this book now.
- Overarching Decisions - we will eventually capture these as an ADR in markdown 
(/specs/adrs will contain an individual document per major decision.  There will be some initial ones that have to do with general project plan and approach, but more may be added as the project goes on.  The main point of this capture is to explain why choices are made.  As brainstorming may have your team settle on choices quickly capturing them in a document may be better than just mental consensus) 
- User Centered Thinking Documents - we will produce personas and potentially use cases. (/specs/users will contain this but user stories chosen will also be represented as issues to work on)
System Diagrams - we will eventually capture how your app will be decomposed in C4 diagram, event modeling diagram, or UML form


- Interface Design Documents - we will initially capture "fat marker design" later extended with wireframes and high fidelity prototypes (/specs/interface/rough, /specs/interface/wireframes, /specs/interface/highfidelity  These directories may contain single or multitude of documents)


- Project Roadmap - we will capture a roadmap of how the product will evolve both here in the quarter as well as ideas of how it might grow beyond the time we have with  (/specs/roadmap.md)

### Went over people’s features they found in the initial brainstorm: Initial Brainstorm
Horoscope reading is popular in today’s age - could implement as a feature that could be well appreciated by users (AK) 

Like the idea of adding certain categories to specify the fortune telling (JT)

Get additional user input to make the fortune telling more personable - get info about job, school, location, etc. - makes it more believable (CK)

Add user authentication - may be a later feature that is added. (JH)

Possibly add in palm reading - user takes photo of palm, but we use pre generated answers - sort of placebo effect. (RL)

Add in more questions between opening question and final fortune - gain more info on user to specialize response. Add delay on reveal (EC)

Make responses seem really specific even though they can be applied to a large group of people - Barnum Effect
Fortune cookies for visual effect - add sound to make it more believable (PC)

Good for people who may not be willing to give a lot of personal information to an app
Have a bunch of different prompts to make the tarot card reading seem specific, but they all filter to 3-4 different readings (NO)

Need to start small - mainly only front-end and add in API later as we develop the app further
At what point can we start inputting API, how can we use AI to generate code/other sources to expand features
We need to find features that we can add focusing mainly on front end

What features can we combine from our reference app into our own service of fortune telling?
- Can always modify certain features to make them unique
Offer options based on amount of info people will want to give to the apps
Features we have chosen:
Maybe start Tarot cards first to prove we have a working feature then use API to create Horoscope


How can we create separate features in the app? 
Horoscope - possibly create a feature that uses horoscope manipulation/what to do in relationships based on partner’s astrological sign. 
Tarot cards: lay out a bunch of cards and user selects - user has a sense of control over fate (BIG THING) even though it is still quite random - like the card calls to you. 
Figure out how to lay cards out based on user’s input?

### What features presented people liked:
- Tarot cards, integrated with asking multiple questions - can make the response more personalized
- Horoscopes - seems personalized even though a lot of people are born in the same month - plus can give a new reading every day - keeps users coming back for more. 
- Tarot cards: good app design - well designed cards may pull people in to use the app - can give relevant information/advice because of users multiple inputs
- Horoscop: different reading for each day - every day is unique which is pretty nice, but tarot cards give more specific information - gives you a clear answer too - more user friendly in terms of people . Horoscopes can be quite confusing if you don’t understand terminology
- Horoscope:  possibly add a chinese zodiac feature that is similar but do prefer horoscope based on everyday change in the outcome
- Tarot Cards: allows users to have more input in the outcome of their reading - more engaged in their experience. 
- Makes choices for you: what if the Tarot cards suggests a cuisine to go to? Can have Tarot cards focused on making choices for you rather than giving info about your personality. (doesn’t have to be tarot cards specifically)
- Horoscopes: easiest to design - Tarot cards require animation and cards being shuffled - horoscope mainly just outputs text - easier to make look pretty. 

## Action Items:
- Thinking about users and their expectations 
- Deciding on your app's theme or mood
- Start to diagram and define features. 	

## Next Meeting Time:
Sunday 4/30 @ 2:00pm, Zoom

### End Time: 
6:38pm
