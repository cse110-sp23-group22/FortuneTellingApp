# Discussion Notes:
Link to brainstorm 2: [Thematic Feature Brainstorm](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1KTIoLax0I5NBpaeFd74EF0osEXfcg3OSWvvBKoaqWsQ/edit)
- Ideas to iterate for horoscope
  - Essentially we want to improve the story surrounding our application
  - Right now we have the basic functionality down - we can accurately return a horoscope to the reader based on their information
  - Focus now on improving animations + lore
  - Include page transitions - fade in/fade out
  - Going to reinvent the horoscope to fit with our lore: 
  - We have to balance out the tarot card development and horoscope as well
  - Slowly add on to horoscope so that at the end of each iteration, we still have the base product
  - This way we always have a usable product at end of every iteration


One concern - we want to focus on functionality, testing, github repo/cicd pipeline stuff as that is main focus of the project - how it looks isn’t as big a concern. 

- Leaning towards moving with tarot cards and horoscope together

- Need to better split up/define tasks - some cases there wasn’t enough work for the whole group
- Some tasks may take more people than others, but basically create tasks in better form such that each person has a subtask 
- Better communication between people and groups - in between subteams

- Focus more on specific tasks and letting people do more of what they want so they are more passionate about them and they can have multiple tasks to do, so they can keep developing. 
Other user stories
- Shop with only two items (maybe like a peddler) [Just the story]
- Try to limit to table, card stack (decoration), and book. If you have to add a figure use a 
Tasks
- Create new homepage graphic with clickable graphics
- Make tarot card basic functionality
- Make transitions between horoscope input and reading.
- Add SFX to horoscope transition between input and output


Ideas to deal with the “standing around” issue
- Have a smaller meeting to break down the task into smaller tasks.
- If the task cannot be broken down
  - Perhaps have a dangling person go over to another team.
Doable via: 
- Increase development speed, to increase the number of job tickets
- Allow teams to pick more tasks. Even if people split up a task into fewer subtasks than there are people, those extra people can do a different task.
- Roadmap

### Next steps
- We need some people with ideas to perform the double-diamond process Powell described specifically on Horoscope/Home Page/whole app aesthetic; however, not everyone necessarily wants to spend effort on something they may not care as much about.
## Action Items:
- Eric and Ryan finish out brainstorm #2
- Create and Assign more tasks - don’t be afraid to make more than may seem possible just so everyone has something to do. 
## Next Meeting Time:
Sunday 6/4 @ 2:00pm, Zoom

End Time: 
9:20 pm
