Possibly write down what we want the app to look like at end of quarter - vision of what you want it to look like - give better purpose for dev - establishes roadmap. 
(3 biggest discussion topics):

Topic: Uncertainty over project vision/purpose:

Autonomy since each individual has their specialities - makes sense with more time, learning and implementing at same time - possibly reduce scope of what we are supposed to do - basically define specs and reqs better so that there isn’t so much guess work. 
The project is very small - in exchange we can figure out how group communication works. Git repo works, group setup - this is main focus of class rather than creating a full scale app. 
However, we still want to create an app that is meaningful project that we want to create something we enjoy and something that we are happy with what we have made. 
Give team members more room to go out and develop - they want to develop but unsure if it is viable, will be appreciated by team. 
Team members shouldn’t be afraid with coming up to team members and leaders on their ideas/what they see
Scared that if one person starts then ideas will flood in - might screw up with progress/roadmap
How can we control everyone’s ideas and put it on one page - focus for the next sprint.


Low Bus Factor:

Want more communication between teams - feel like each team is in isolation from one another
Reminder that team channels in slack aren’t restricted - don’t feel afraid to pop a question in another team’s channel and ask for more info 
Also talk to team leaders if you want more information on tasks and what other teams are doing. 
Possibly do more to facilitate communication better between teams. 

Skill Issue:

Too rushed a timeline - haven’t able to develop and process thematic characteristics of app given time. Want to include more of these things in the app - want to try out more advanced development practices like we have learned in the class
It is a fairly rushed timeline so it is tough to actually develop too far, we are trying to include as much as possible, but not able to include everything
Try to incorporate as much new development things over next couple of weeks. 

## Action Items
Create roadmap to give more clarity and details on development and final look of project
