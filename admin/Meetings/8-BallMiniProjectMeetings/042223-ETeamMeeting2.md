### Time

> 4/22 10:30am - 12:10pm PST, Remote (Zoom)

## Attendees

Chris, Eric, Jessica(Note taker)

### Before the meeting:

What S-Team is asking for:

- graphics for the page
- Ask explore to use AI to get code for features
- Feature 1: shake button shake
- Feature 2: sound
- Feature 3: graphic

## During the meeting:

- The AI gave us the 8 ball app with a shaking effect and also a shaking sound effect(even tho we didn’t ask for it)
- Tested the AI-generated code, Chapgpt only gave us 8 ball app with a shaking sound but not the shaking effect
- Chris’s willing to learn JS skills
- Eric comes in and says he already has experimental notes from a test session
- Code originally had a lot of classes/ids with shaking in their name, but no actual shaking
- Chatgpt called html php
- We fixed the shaking effect porting code from the functional shaking-button-only code, then adding “.shaking” instead of # shake-button

AI art generating tool:

- Midjourney
- Stable diffusion - the prompt have to be specific, keep generating till get a one u like, it’s getting better (prefer using this one)

### FOR S-TEAM:

- Online js runner: https://jsfiddle.net/
- We tried let gpt to give us shaking effect, it worked generally but, still had some bug
- In the css file line 60 (we changed #shake-button to shaking and it worked)
- We asked the gpt to see if it can make the web look better but if only worked a bit
- We aksed give some color like coral pink and light blue
- What we were looking for was it will generate some pink/light background turned out it only changed the font color
- The shaking sound worked
- Using audio tag in html and css
- We used stable diffusion to generate some cool 8-ball pics, u can try to use it and here are some pics that we like

And we are thinking about if we can make some cool effects on the 8 ball instead of the shake button
Eg: shake the ball pic instead of the shake button

I will upload today’s code the same git hub repo
