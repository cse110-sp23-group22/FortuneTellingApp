## Team Progress:
- Integrate the graphics for the 8-ball
- Update the shake feature to match what explore found
- Starting on new features. 
## Agenda:
- Look over what explore team has already acquired from AI
- Check for possible bugs, places we can improve
- Integrate graphics from explore
- Implement human code into the AI code to see how to make it better

## Discussion Notes:
- Worked mainly on putting in the graphics, rearranging elements to 
### What part(s) of AI code works:
- The shaking effect works - integrated with stable version to improve performance
- Graphics work well - working to integrating them into the design

### What part(s) of AI code do we need to change:
- Not much, explore mainly gave us images to work with. 
- Generated Chinese responses - translations a little mechanic but still solid
### Features Added:
- Add the button image and make its corner rounded
- Added the 8-ball image onto the button itself - image shakes when clicked
- Add delay between when the ball stops shaking and when the output is displayed
- Cleared the output between each click of the 8-ball. 
- Adding additional languages in drop down
- Additional Features We Should Add:
- Better background?
- Animation for the text appearing in the 8-ball
- Name text box appears before person can click the 8-ball
- Make the 8-ball larger?
- Chat history?
- Space detector in question?
- Make certain responses more likely than others?

### Action Items:
- Ask explore team for an image of the back of the 8-ball so that we can display text in it
- Maybe just a floating 8-ball(no hands) - white outline on the 8-ball(so it stands out from background)
- Ask them for code to animate the text fading out from the 8-ball
- Ideally we want an 8-ball with an empty white space where the text can appear
- Generate a background for the page so it doesnâ€™t look bare - something like galaxy background?
- Change variable and file names for cleaner organization.
- Finish putting language JSON together 
- Ask E-team to figure out language JSON selection feature
- Ask E-team to figure out how to output Chinese characters
